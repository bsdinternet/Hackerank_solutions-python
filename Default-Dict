Topic: Default Dict
Definintion of Default Dict->-> it is similar to dictionary but the key is default will be sit if the key is not given
Explaination:
-> two inputs are used to create a group(containers) of A and B 
-> where A values are n will be repeated in the container
-> where B values are m will act has a key of Group a n values
-> Our Job is to find the index's that n values match with m values 
-> if not matched then it need to return -1

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
from collections import defaultdict
d=defaultdict(list)
n,m= map(int,input().split())

for i in range(1,n+1):
    v=input()
    d[v].append(i)
    
for i in range(m):
    k=input()
    if k in d:
        print(*d[k],sep=" ")
    else:
        print(-1)
