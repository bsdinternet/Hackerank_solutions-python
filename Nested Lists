Topic: Nested Lists

Explaination: Creating a Lists with 2 sub sets of data 
              Example: students = [['Harry', 37.21], ['Berry', 37.21], ['Tina', 37.2], ['Akriti', 41], ['Harsh', 39]]
              here at first-> We get input of how many students 
              here we need to find who is the lowest grade in the list 
              If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.
              
---------------Code---------------
if __name__ == '__main__':
    dic={}
    s=list()
    no_students= int(input())

    for _ in range(no_students):
        name = input()
        score = float(input())
        
        if score in dic:
            dic[score].append(name)
        else:
            dic[score]=[name]
        
        if score not in s:
            s.append(score)
    
    m=min(s)
    s.remove(m)
    m1=min(s)
    dic[m1].sort()
    for i in dic[m1]:
        print(i)
